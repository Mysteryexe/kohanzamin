            <p class="about">Founded by Darius I in 518 B.C., Persepolis was the capital of the Achaemenid Empire. It
              was built on an
              immense half-artificial, half-natural terrace, where the king of kings created an impressive palace
              complex inspired by Mesopotamian models. The importance and quality of the monumental ruins make it a
              unique archaeological site.</p>

              Isfahan. In fact, the gathering of many ancient monuments of this city is in Naghsh Jahan Square. This
              beautiful square has had many ups and downs during its life in different governments and has been
              neglected by the rulers at different times; But today it has a lot of glorious fans all over the world.
              The site’s inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List demonstrates the importance of the area.</p>

              The complex was constructed in the 19th century and belonged to the Qajar era monarchs and their families.
              In 1920s Shah Reza Pahlavi added some buildings to the complex and used the palace as a summer residence.
              In 1970s his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi moved there. In 1979, after the Islamic Revolution, the complex
              became a museum. Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization operates and maintains the complex.</p>

                <span class="big">Persepolis</span> was the Greek name of the city. It simply means “the city of the
                Persians.” This reflects its
                importance as the heart of the Achaemenid Empire. Even though it was not a city in the usual sense of
                the
                word, and even though it didn’t exactly have a huge permanent population or produce many things, it was
                an
                important symbol of the power of the king of kings, (the power of Darius I in particular).

                  One of the most famous historical cities of Iran is definitely Persepolis. While Iran has had many
                  large
                  cities and important capitals, including Ecbatana, Arsacia, Ctesiphon, and others, none have quite
                  captured the imagination quite like Persepolis.

                <p class="norm">
                  <span class="big">Where is Persepolis?</span><br>

                  Persepolis is located in the province of Fars in southern Iran. It is close to the major modern city
                  of
                  Shiraz. It was essentially constructed in the very heart of the Achaemenid Empire. The modern province
                  of Fars roughly corresponds to ancient Parsa, which was considered the land of the Persians. While the
                  Achaemenid Persians had several extremely important cities as well as other capitals, Persepolis was
                  definitely a site of great psychological importance for the Empire even if it was not a standard city.

                  During the Safavid period, with the change of the capital from Qazvin to Isfahan, the era of the glory
                  of this square began and its grounds became the location of government buildings and the Shah’s
                  palace.

                  Shah Abbas Safavid, with the aim of expanding the city to its southern part on the outskirts of
                  Zayandehrood, by employing skilled architects such as Ustad Mohammad Reza and Ali Akbar Isfahani,
                  established the original building of this square. In the design and construction of this square and
                  its
                  historical monuments, it is inspired by the architectural style of the Iranian square, of which
                  prominent examples are Isfahan’s Atiq Square, Amir Chakhmaq Square in Yazd, Shah Square and Sahebabad
                  Square of Qazvin pointed out.

                  The original foundation of the present form of Imam Square was built in 1603 and gradually the
                  construction of the square and its buildings was completed by 1616. The work of decorating mosques and
                  buildings began in 1616 and continued until the reign of two of Shah Abbas’ successors.
                  During the last Safavid kings, Shah Suleiman and Shah Sultan Hussein, Naghsh Jahan Square lost its
                  glory and suffered a lot of damage. This process of destruction intensified during the Ashraf Afghan
                  invasion of Isfahan and continued until the Qajar period. Many parts of the mansion were destroyed due
                  to the negligence of the Qajar kings. Due to the change of the capital from Isfahan, little attention
                  was paid to this prominent square in the center of Isfahan.
